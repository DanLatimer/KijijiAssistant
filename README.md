# KijijiAssistant
An app to help remember the searches that matter to you and make it easy to check them over and over by using a Image based UI.

This is an android app I was working on to display classified ads from websites such as Kijiji in an Image centric grid. The idea was to allow someone to create searches and have them saved in the navigation pane. They could be checked again and again and sorted by certain criteria to allow someone who is hunting for a deal to be able to regularly check for new ads.

Unfortunately while Kijiji does have a restful API, they no longer are accepting new users so I gave up on this. Feel free to reuse the code for other similar projects or in any way that is helpful to you.
